      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Chess has a long and storied history. The game has changed quite a bit
        from its earliest forms in India. The modern iteration we enjoy today
        wasn't known until the 16th century. There were no clocks, and the
        pieces were not standardized until the 19th century. The official world
        championship title came into existence by the late 19th century, shortly
        after the first big tournaments were held and multiple styles of play
        had begun to fully develop. Although the first book on openings was
        published as early as 1843, theory as we know it didn't truly evolve
        until the early/mid 20th century. Computer engines and databases didn't
        come into play until the very late 20th century.
